			<h1>World & Factions</h1>
			<p>Verse of Ascension has 6 factions in total, 3 major factions, and 3 minor factions. The three main factions are the hunters, slayers, and vanguards.</p><br>
			<p>Hunters, slayers and vanguards play vital roles in society. The hunters track down monsters outside their cities, eliminating the largest threats and protecting their cities from the strongest monsters. hunters are also peacekeepers, setting relationships with seperate factions and cities to avoid conflict and war. the slayers are essentally assasins, hunting down high priority human targets, or killing the corrupt, a race of monsters changed from human to a rabid mosnters, hunters also deal with these corrupt if no slayers are avalible. vanguards act as police in the walls, apprehending villains and keeping the peace inside the walls, they tend to avoid using weapons for the risk of killing, which hunters and slayers are not limited by.</p><br>
			<p>Raiders are one of the three lesser class of factions, a group were civilans can act in. Raiders take act in destroying Dungeons in the cities, portals that open up to labyrinths full of monsters, that Raiders can enter, kill the monsters and earn money, Hunters, Slayers, and Vanguards can all do this as well, but is typically frowned apon as its a steady way for civilians to generate income. the second minor faction are known as the shamans, a group of people wielding corruption instead of magic and hunting down Curses, a form of monster only visible to the shamans. Finally, the last minor factions are the knights, a group of fiighters running under a provessional hunter, slayer or vanguard, and creates a group of fighters that aid in the help of protecting the cities outside the main ones, essentially vanguards, but less known, and not a strong, as they dont experience official training.</p>
