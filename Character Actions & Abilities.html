			<h1>powers & fundamentals</h1>
			<p>The magic system of Ascension is unique as it does not have one or two magical power types, but a bundle of different variations and types, but the main power type would be the world attribute.</p><br>
<p>The world attribute of magic stems from two different lineages of magic types, Infinity Types, and Power Types. their most distictive attribute between them is how strong a user is born. Infinity Types work like an RPG, where by using that skill, it grows stronger and stronger over time, gaining more unique and special powers along the way, and have no limit to how strong a user can go, like if a character from a game had no level cap to how high they can level up. Infinty is also known as the more versatile and tricky to deal with, as Infinity users tend to be much wider is skills and variants with their magical element, like being able to change fire to a solid, or a liquid, or water being changed to shift and change like fire, or air growing tough sealing you in a prison, Infinity magic is known as the most versatile, and all their magic is a form or change of elemental magic.</p><br>
<p>Power is the other attribute of magic, taking form in manipulation or change in prexexisting objects, like changing gold to stone, or able to manipulate a weapons size and shape. power types do not possess the ability to level up in the same manner of infinity, and cannot learn branching techniques like the infinity line, but instead excel at a single point to the max, unlike the infinity type, power types possess a limit to their power, but at birth are born at max, so skills rely on application and creativity on how one uses their abilities.</p>
			<p>A secondary ability in this world is corruption, an energy controlled by creatures known as the corrupt, Devils, or Curses, creatures that were previously human, monsters, or fused by the negative emotions of humans. this energy has been shown to be controlable, but those able to control it typically work with a group known as the shamans, a group that hunts curses. theirs been around one or two prominent curse users in other factions of fighters, but are typically scorned for their vile power.</p>
